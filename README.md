# Recipe app

![](./app//assets/images/screenshot.png)

The Recipe app keeps track of all the recipes, ingredients, and inventory. It will allow you to save ingredients, keep track of what you have, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on what you have and what you are missing from a recipe. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking the app should allow to make them public so anyone can access them.
